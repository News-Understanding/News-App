  description:
      '''NEW DELHI: IndiGo has reported a profit of Rs 189 crore in the July-September 2023 quarter, as opposed to a loss of Rs 1,583 crore in Q2 last fiscal. India’s largest domestic airline saw its total income rise 21% to Rs 15,503 crore this Q2 from Rs 12,582 crore last time.

                  IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers said: “…another profitable quarter despite the seasonal fluctuations and external headwinds coming into play. With our clear strategy and focus on execution, we have completed a full cycle and remained profitable for the last four quarters. We continued to augment our network both domestically and internationally as we added 10 new destinations in the past few months, taking the total number of destinations to 115 as of today.”
                  The airline had a total cash balance of Rs 30,665.8 crore as on September 30, 2023, comprising Rs 18,082.7 crore of free and Rs 12,583.1 crore restricted cash.

  description:
      '''China’s spy agency pledged to help prevent financial sector risks from jeopardizing the country’s national security, as the secretive organization becomes more visible under President Xi Jinping.
        “State security organs should attach greater importance to preventing and defusing financial risks,” the Ministry of State Security said in a post on WeChat on Thursday. They should also “actively participate in the development of national security systems in the economy, finance and other areas,” it added.

  title: "AFM: South Korean Tentpole ‘Noryang: Deadly Sea’ Sells to Japan",
  description:
      '''Major U.S. acquisitions of Asian film titles have been scarce at the American Film Market so far this year, but business within the region nonetheless has been humming. The much-anticipated Korean period action tentpole Noryang: Deadly Sea has scored a deal at AFM for Japan distribution with Tokyo-based Twin Co. Ltd.

Seoul-based sales agent Acemaker is repping the title to international buyers.

The film is the third and final title in director Kim Han-min’s trilogy about battles led by the famed Korean admiral Yi Sun-sin that started with The Admiral: Roaring Currents in 2014 and was followed by Hansan: Rising Dragon in 2022. The first film earned \$138 million worldwide, which was the most ever by a Korean film at the time.
The new installment depicts the historical Battle of Noryang, the last major battle of the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598). The new film stars Kim Yoon-seok as Yi Sun-sin, along with Baek Yoon-sik, Jung Jae-young and Huh Joon-ho.

The film’s official summary reads: “In 1598, the seven-year Imjim War nears an end as Wae invaders prepare to withdraw from Joseon. Admiral Yi Sun-shin leads an allied fleet of Joseon and Ming ships to annihilate the Wae army. Joseon, Ming and Wae forces clash at Noryang Straight, the deadly sea where Admiral Yi fights his last valiant battle.”

Noryang: Deadly Sea is produced by Big Stone Pictures and distributed in Korea by Lotte Pictures. It is scheduled to be released at home in South Korea sometime in December.''',
